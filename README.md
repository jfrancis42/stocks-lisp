# stocks-lisp
A Common Lisp client for pulling stock information from Google's
public stock API.

This is a trivial package (you could provide equivalent functionality
(minus error checking) in one line of code, if you wanted), but saves
having to re-invent the wheel each time you need some basic stock
data.

I won't pretend to understand every one of these returned values, I
wrote this mostly to grab :L and :C. I assume anyone familiar with
stock trading can make use of the rest of the returned values.
