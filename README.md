# stocks-lisp
A Common Lisp client for pulling stock information from Google's public stock API.

This is a trivial package (it is, in fact, one single line of CL code), but saves having to re-invent the wheel each time you need some basic stock data.

I won't pretend to understand every one of these returned values, I wrote this mostly to grab :L and :C. I assume anyone familiar with stock trading can make use of the rest of the returned values.
